== protocol ==

* only fetch index where there is an update
  [DONE] the HMAC is now announced to help Forban to discover updated index

== portability ==

* include a default CherryPy in the package
  [DONE] done now in ./lib/ext/
* or remove CherryPy requirements (and/or (re)implement the minimal HTTP services requirement)
** -> to just rely on a standard Python with no additional module (Nokia N900 test)

* win32 test and support
  [DONE] in 0.0.18 / issue with os.rename in Windows + win32 killing process added
  [OPEN] more test to be done in opportunistic mode

== opportunistic ==

* limit the timeout when the HTTP service is not responding
  [DONE] socket.setdefaulttimeout(10) is globally set in the fetching library
  -> Maybe this could be variable following the stability of the hosts discovered / link stability
* be sure that the list of host to contact is randomized (-> issues of bootstrapping a lot of local Forban services)
* calculate a weight factor based on the content proposed by the different Forban
* variable numbers of parallel fetcher
** -> 2 fetchers idea (one starting with small files and one starting with large files)
* reduce time to flood the announces (or make it variable ?)
  [DONE] 10sec now default but can be configured
  [DONE] opportunistic wake-up is function of the announce time
