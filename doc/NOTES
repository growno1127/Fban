== portability ==

* include a default CherryPy in the package
* or remove CherryPy requirements (and/or (re)implement the minimal HTTP services requirement)
** -> to just rely on a standard Python with no additional module (Nokia N900 test)

== opportunistic ==

* limit the timeout when the HTTP service is not responding
* be sure that the list of host to contact is randomized (-> issues of bootstrapping a lot of local Forban services)
* calculate a weight factord based on the content proposed by Forban
* reduce time to flood the announces (or make it variable ?)
  [DONE] 10sec now default but can be configured
  [DONE] opportunistic wake-up is function of the announce time
